        Human Resource Management (HRM) in IAF involves attracting, developing, and retaining talent. One major challenge is to plan optimal transfers of officers across units, locations, and roles, based on qualifications, performance, and preferences. Existing methods are often manual, subjective, and inefficient, leading to high costs, low accuracy, and poor satisfaction.
